Getting Started
=================================================================================

Importing AdPlayer Project into Eclipse
-----------------------------------------

1) File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace
2) Check "Select root directory"
2) Click Browse and select the GIT repository, which should already be cloned
   to the system.
3) Ensure the directory is selected under the "Projects" section.
4) Click "Finish"
5) Project should be imported to current workspace


Building AdPlayer Project
-----------------------------------------
1) Right click "build.xml" > Run As > Ant Build
2) A new "build" directory will be created containing the Ant build output.
3) Note: Eclipse may require you to refresh the project folder's view. This can
   be done easily by right clicking the project folder and clicking "Refresh."
	

Testing
-----------------------------------------
1) Open the generated demo.html file from the demo directory in your 
   favorite browser.
	
	 Note:
     - The demo.html file in the demo folder can not be used for
       testing directly. Use the one in the build folder instead!
     - The test page (demo.html) currently uses static ADTECH test tags.
